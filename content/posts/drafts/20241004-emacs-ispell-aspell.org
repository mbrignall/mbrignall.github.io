* British English and Emacs

I like writing and was keen to introduce an on-the-fly spellchecker in Emacs. Ispell is built in to the current version I'm using (29.1). However it was locked to the default US dictionary. Easy fix right?

** Discoveries

Out the box the latest version of ispell on Nix Packages and built in Emacs does not have UK/British English default. So I started looking on Reddit and Googled ispell and Nix to see where I could go.

** Emacs philosophy and approach

I am a strong believer in keeping things simple and with the introduction of 'use-package' and the extra features in 29.1 I was keen to rewrite my config and use as close to vanilla setup as possible. I took the very base of what was needed and started from scratch building outward and exploring built-in packages.
