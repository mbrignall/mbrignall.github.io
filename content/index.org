Here, I will be documenting my journey, sharing my thoughts, findings, and learnings in various fields that interest me. This space will evolve as I experiment, explore, and expand my knowledge.

I hope you find something useful or thought-provoking!

In this blog, you'll likely find me talking about my favourite tech. I may, from time to time, speak of other interests outside the tech realm. I may even cover topics that overlap with creative, technology and otherworldly interests. I promise I will try not to bore you too much.

  I haven’t finished it yet, but it’s a look into the early days of computer security, hacking, and investigation.

  So far: good!

  I'm taking time to get through books nowadays so keep an eye out for anything of interest as time goes by.
