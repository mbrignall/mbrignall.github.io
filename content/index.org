This space will evolve as I experiment, explore, and expand my knowledge. I use this space so I can personally revisit items of interest, store knowledge and maybe achievements.

** What to expect

You'll likely find me talking about my favourite technologies. I may, from time to time, speak of other interests. I may even cover topics that overlap with creative and otherworldly interests.

I hope you find something useful or thought-provoking!

*** Some topics, themes, and subjects

- *Cyber Defence and Security Engineering*
- *Web Development and Web Design*
- *Me talking profusely, and lovingly about Emacs*
- *My own experiments, code snippets*
- *Single Board Computers*

Will review once finished
