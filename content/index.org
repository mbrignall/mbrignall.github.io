I use this space so I can personally revisit items of interest, store knowledge and maybe achievements.

** What to expect

You'll likely find me talking about my favourite technologies. I may, from time to time, speak of other interests. I may even cover topics that overlap with creative and otherworldly interests.

I hope you find something useful or thought-provoking!

Some topics, themes, and subjects:

- *Cybersecurity and Security Engineering*
- *Web Development and Web Design*
- *Talking lovingly about Emacs*
- *Experiments, code snippets and projects*
- *Single Board Computer exploration*

* Current Book(s) @@html:<i class="fa-solid fa-book"></i>@@

So far this book is awesome and intriguing. I have only read the first few chapters and listened to her music for sometime, but hadn't been aware of her strange career.

I am half way through this book so far, it's fascinating. Covering the beginning of code/bits/bytes up to modern computing. It has illuminated some points of computing that I have not covered for some time. More on that soon.

I think I hit a bit of a roof on this one when it started to get super techincal, I decided to take the second half a bit slower.

In Progress... Still in progress.
