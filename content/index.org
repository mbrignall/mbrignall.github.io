Here, I will be documenting my journey, sharing my thoughts, findings, and learnings in various fields that interest me. This space will evolve as I experiment, explore, and expand my knowledge.

I hope you find something useful or thought-provoking!

** What to expect

In this blog, you'll likely find me talking about my favourite tech. I may, from time to time, speak of other interests outside the tech realm. I may even cover topics that overlap with creative, technology and otherworldly interests. I promise I will try not to bore you too much.

*** Some topics, themes, and subjects

- *Cyber Defense and Security Engineering*
- *Web Development and DevOps*
- *Me talking profusely, and lovingly about Emacs*
- *My own experiments, code snippets*
- *reflections on various projects and tools*
