* About me... @@html:<i class="fa-regular fa-address-card"></i>@@

During the day I work as a Cyber Security professional in an Incident Response team. When not blocking attackers and analysing threats I can be found playing guitar.

My musical influences include:

  - Jim O’Rourke
  - John Fahey
  - Django Reinhardt

 I enjoy exploring blues and post-rock, metal and sub-genres of. I have a background in Music Tech and spent many hours building devices and instruments using Raspberry Pi, [[https://puredata.info/][Pure Data]] and the fun music communities I discovered along the way. Maybe I'll cover those here at some point 🤔

Here is a neat (I think) playlist of some of my faves:

* Linux things @@html:<i class="fa-regular fa-file-code"></i>@@

For some time now I've been obsessed with Linux, more specifically NixOS and most recently Guix SD. I discovered a rich world of possibilities upon realising that I could craft my systems declaritively.

At work I'm using MacOS so am using Nix Darwin as a Flake for that:

A more recent edition is Guix SD and I've taken inspiration from a variety of sources which I'll cover in a post shortly:

*** STARTED Plan 9/ 9front

Just started using 9front over the holiday period, I'll record findings, so far I love it. I am looking for old laptops to run the OS on bare metal. I have two options that are in various states:

   - Raspberry Pi 3b: Running 9front successfully.
   - Thinkpad T420: currently not booting, potential system board fail.

     After some diagnosis and testing it turned out the system board was gone, so a replacement was ordered. Going to cover this in more detail, but replacing board has fixed the issues and now we have a working 9front install.
   
   - ASUS eee PC 901: Power issues, but does boot, replacing power cable.
