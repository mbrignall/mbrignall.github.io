* I grew up in Gloucestershire…

I wasn’t very academic and moved to London at 19 to pursue music. I played guitar (mostly fingerstyle) and occasionally bass and banjo. I was influenced by musicians like Jim O’Rourke, John Fahey, and Django Reinhardt, but my interests span many genres: blues, post-rock, metal, and more.

* Into the tech stadium

** Tech Beginnings
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: 97B36D86-81A7-4ABE-A45D-F313494F030D
:END:
I grew up around tech, thanks to my dad, an engineer. My early interest came from fixing tech problems for others. Around 8 years ago, I joined OVO Energy, which started my career in tech.

** Customer Support Days
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: 83A173C8-7AD0-4B0F-BBB3-66339527E604
:END:
I started in customer support, taking calls for PAYG meters, where autonomy and ‘doing the right thing’ mattered. Eventually, I moved to a more technical Second Line team, dealing with escalations across various industry areas.

** Transition to Tech Support
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: 9AF41BBC-483F-45BC-8D9A-259315FFFCF7
:END:
I applied for Tech Support and loved it immediately—immersed in solving technical issues, learning from experts, and benefiting from a flexible, startup-like culture.

** Learning Atlassian Admin
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: 358C9A6F-EC26-4BDF-9EA8-D09D05A130C2
:END:
I saw an opportunity to help the Atlassian admin team with their backlog. I dove into Jira and Service Management projects while still supporting general tech queries, learning to improve and automate workflows.

During this time I helped introduce the business to their AI chatbot offering: Virtual Agent. This offers a workflow based Slack workflow that creates tickets when matching the intent of a requester. This was the ground basis for the GCP vend that is mentioned in the next section.

* DevEx and me

** Developer Experience
After helping introduce ‘zero-touch’ MDM platforms and managing Atlassian admin work, I joined the Developer Experience team. We built new processes like automating GCP project requests and deploying AI-driven Slack bots, while focusing on cloud-native concepts and DevOps practices.

*** Automating GCP Project Vends
In our GCP vend process:
- Requests came through Slack, triggering Jira tickets
- A bot asked key questions, checking project names for uniqueness
- Jira triggered an AWS Lambda via SNS, which interfaced with Google’s API to create the project
- Success/failure messages were posted back to Slack for actioning

This was about enabling engineers while building the guardrails needed for our growing cloud infrastructure.

* Security Time!
