* About me...

During the day I work as a Cyber Security professional in an Incident Response team. When not blocking attackers and analysing threats I can be found playing guitar.

My musical influences include:

  - Jim Oâ€™Rourke
  - John Fahey
  - Django Reinhardt

 I enjoy exploring blues and post-rock, metal and sub-genres of. I have a background in Music Tech and spent many hours building devices and instruments using Raspberry Pi, [[https://puredata.info/][Pure Data]] and the fun music communities I discovered along the way. Maybe I'll cover those here at some point ðŸ¤”

Here is a neat (I think) playlist of some of my faves:

** Linux things

For some time now I've been obsessed with Linux, more specifically NixOS and most recently Guix SD. I discovered a rich world of possibilities upon realising that I could craft my systems declaritively.

At work I'm using MacOS so am using Nix Darwin as a Flake for that:

A more recent edition is Guix SD and I've taken inspiration from a variety of sources which I'll cover in a post shortly:
