* Cuckoo's Egg by Cliff Stoll :cybersecurity:truecrime:

The hacker didn't succeed through sophistication. Rather he poked at obvious places, trying to enter through unlock doors. Persistence, not wizardry, let him through.

This book is an excellent dive into the cyber security field during the late 80's. Cliff Stoll depicts the challenges and excitement around identifying a person with unauthorised access inside their network.

One day in 1986 Stolls' supervisor asks him to resolve an accounting error of 75 cents in the computer usage accounts. This event triggers a chase that spans the entire book, with Cliff at the forefront, tracking the hackers every move.

Ultimately exploiting a vulnerability in the GNU Emacs package 'movemail', the hacker was able to traverse the network and other neighbouring networks of various government and military facilities, stealing documents, files, passwords and other data. 

Not only does the story detail everything from the key strokes to the tools/programs used (including key loggers and trojan horses), Stoll also covers tricky it was to monitor the hacker across multiple continents.

Stoll welcomes the reader into not just his professional life but also the personal relationship between him and his partner, Martha. The rushing off from dates during the chase, building the tension between them, adds a great layer to the story. 

On occasion the book felt a little like groundhog day due to the repetitive events of the hacker appearing and then disappearing again in short succession. Stolls' frustration expressed of the authorities and policing of cyber crime during the time shows just how far the field has come.

Currently listening to the book during my commute. From the opening chapter about Pablo Escobar laundering physical, hard cash to the later chapters covering crypto/blockchain game coins it's a wild ride start to finish. A few key factors and personal observations:

Business Email Compromise (BEC) is unlikely to go anywhere! The email inbox is still a highly effective attack surface for any business or individual. It's also the easiest method to be compromised.

Money laundering and Cyber crime in general are mutually exclusive. Even the most intelligent, highly operative Cyber criminals who can hack systems, compromise organisations and individuals are reliant on the specialists that head up the money laundering industry for their services.
